- dotfile pretty print session defaults
- deriving debug was removed for processes and sessions, although it would be
  nice to manually request this if possible
- program trait
- more trace! log messages in process run loops
- finer time granularity (microseconds?)
- link to sessions in program dotfile output
    - program dotfile is a state machine dotfile from macro-machines-- this may
      need to be modified or else link by parsing and modifying the dotfile
      output itself
